## Background

The food bank inventory app is for people who want to see the current inventory of a food bank. Guest users can click on available food items to see nutritional information. Admin users can manage the inventory by making changes to the available food categories and items. Admin users can only be created with the correct secret key.

Inspired by the Yolo Food Bank.
